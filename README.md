simple-csv-tokenizer

parse a CSV string in JavaScript, return an array of CSV parts

why
===

it's never come up in 13+ years of __front end development__ but it did come up 
as an interview question last year ~ I couldn't solve it completely (started with
a regex - "now I have two problems") ~ so here I am getting parse muscles into shape.

implementation & tests
======================

*coming shortly*
